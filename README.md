<i>Last updated: 13 July 2023</i>

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- Firebase

## Contributing

NextJS is the main backend framework for this platform. Read the [NextJS docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) before contributing!
<b>Note:</b> This site uses `app` routing, which removes the traditional `pages` and `src` directories.

### How to Run it

First, ensure you have the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
You can check the version by using the `-v` argument.

```console
node -v
```

Once done, clone this repo and run the development server.

```console
git clone <this-repo>
npm install
npm start
```

This should be locally hosted on `http://localhost:3000`.

All static media is managed in the `public` directory. You can easily add more content by uploading them directly in GitHub. The `app` directory includes the general pages of the website. Within the recursive `(public)` directories, you will find the `page.tsx`

<b>Important:</b> Firebase will not allow access to the backend services due to undisclosed environment variables.
